SH4DOW is a modular honeypot and deception intelligence platform designed for high-fidelity signal capture in noisy operational environments. Built for integration with the [SP3CTR](https://github.com/KnifeySpooney/SP3CTR) and [F0RT](https://github.com/KnifeySpooney/F0RT) ecosystem, SH4DOW goes beyond basic trap-setting—its goal is adversary **profiling**, **narrative reconstruction**, and **tactical enrichment**.

---

## ❗ Status

> SH4DOW is currently in **Phase 1: The Sentinel’s Dawn**. Development is in the design and prototyping stage. No stable code has been pushed yet.

---

## 🎯 Mission

Modern defense is flooded with noise—automated scans, idle probes, and misconfigurations disguised as threats. SH4DOW cuts through the static. Instead of asking *“What happened?”*, SH4DOW asks *“Why did it happen, and who made it happen?”*

Its goal is not just detection—but interpretation.

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

**Listeners (Go)**  
Lightweight, compiled daemons emulate vulnerable services like Telnet, FTP, or SSH with configurable responses. Built for concurrency and rapid deployment.

**Core Engine (Python + FastAPI)**  
Receives, parses, tags, and narrates event data. Exposes a secure API for internal modules (SP3CTR/F0RT) and logs to Elasticsearch + PostgreSQL.

**Database Layer (Elasticsearch + PostgreSQL)**  
Hybrid memory design: Elastic for fast, searchable logs; Postgres for long-term actor profiling and system state retention.

**Frontend (React, via F0RT)**  
Interactive dashboard for live maps, timelines, and session replays—embedded as a module in the broader F0RT command console.

## 📦 Future Modules (Planned)

- gRPC-based listener<>core communication
- Embedded actor behavioral tagging
- Deception scripting (custom trap templates)
- Session replay and exploit chain visualization
- Full honeynet orchestration
- Integration with SH4DOW's sibling tool: `SP3CTR`

---

## 🛠 Deployment

Not yet available. Expected stack includes:

- Docker-based microservices
- API gateway with optional reverse proxy (NGINX)
- WS/REST communication between modules
- Minimal overhead listeners suitable for edge-node deployments

## 🗺 Roadmap

Want to track development or contribute when it goes live?  
- Phase 1: Listener + Core Engine MVP  
- Phase 2: Honeynet architecture, deception layer injection  
- Phase 3: Narrative-driven replay engine, deep ML actor profiling  

Stay tuned.
